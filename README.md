# Customized Portfolio
 ## Abstract ##
This paper explores the development of a customized portfolio website utilizing HTML and CSS, augmented by dynamic image features, light and dark mode toggling, and semi-responsive design principles. The primary objective is to create an aesthetically pleasing and functional online presence for individuals or businesses. The project begins with the foundational structure, employing HTML5 to organize content semantically and CSS3 to apply styling. Dynamic image features are integrated to enhance user engagement, including hover effects, image carousels, and modal pop-ups for detailed views. To cater to diverse user preferences and improve accessibility, a light and dark mode switch is implemented using CSS variables and JavaScript, ensuring a seamless transition between themes. The semi-responsive design approach adapts the layout for various screen sizes, prioritizing key breakpoints to ensure a coherent user experience across devices. This combination of static and dynamic elements results in a versatile and visually appealing portfolio that effectively showcases the user's work while offering an interactive and adaptive browsing experience.
